        <h1>Master Mind</h1>

        <h2>(From <em>The Playboy Winner's Guide to Board Games</em> by Jon Freeman, Chicago: Playboy Press, 1979. ISBN
            #0-872-16562-0.)</h2>

        <p>Unless you've spent the last five years in exile on the island of Fernando Poo, you must have seen or heard
            of
            <Strong>Master Mind</Strong> (Invicta Plastics Ltd., USA), the most successful game of recent times; it has
            sold
            tens of millions of copies in half a dozen versions and inspired a multitude of derivatives and imitations.
        </p>

        <p>While not at all complicated, <strong>Master Mind</strong> is (unlike chess or go or
            <strong>Othello</strong>)
            asymmetrical: that is, the two players involved do not begin with identical positions and goals. One, the
            codemaker, drawing from a group of pegs of six different colors, sets up a hidden "code" of four pegs. His
            opponent, the codebreaker, then attempts to guess the codeâ€”to duplicate it on the boardâ€”first at random and
            then
            by using logic to deduce the answer from clues given by the codemaker. These clues are simply a variation of
            a
            guessing game known to every child: a formalized way of saying, "You're cold ... you're warm ... you're
            hot."
            Every time the codebreaker makes a guessâ€”by placing a row of "code pegs" he hopes will duplicate the hidden
            codeâ€”the codemaker places, next to the row, a black "key peg" for every code peg that is the right color and
            in
            the right position (that is, that corresponds <em>exactly</em> to one element of the code) and a white key
            peg
            for each code peg that is of the right color but <em>not</em> in the right place. The codemaker never states
            which key pegs go with which code pegsâ€”that's something the codebreaker has to figure out along the way.
        </p>

        <p>After the codebreaker has deduced the code, the two players trade places and roles. Whoever guesses the
            other's
            code in the fewest number of rows wins the round. Alternatively, players may keep a running total over any
            number of rounds. While some people, particularly under the stress of formal competition, may take forever,
            a
            complete two-game round should take less than half an hour, and fifteen minutes is more typical. With
            practice,
            you should be able to guess the code in an average of five rows or less.<a href="#note1">[&sup1;]</a></p>

        <p>Since <strong>Master Mind</strong> is essentially a game of code<em>breaking</em>, the analysis that follows
            concentrates on the inferences that can be drawn from clues and the kinds of guesses that should be made.
            The
            first point to remember is that there are two kinds of information given by key pegs: their number and their
            color. Often, the former allows clearer deductions than the latter, as we shall see in the following two
            examples. The first is taken from <em>The Official Master Mind Handbook</em> by Leslie H. Ault. It will
            serve as
            an example of what <em>not</em> to do.</p>

        <p>(In the standard <strong>Master Mind</strong> set, black and white are used both as code peg colors and as
            key
            peg colors; to avoid confusion, the diagrams in this discussion use the six colors from <strong>Mini Master
                Mind</strong>. For code pegs, ðŸŸ¢ = green, ðŸ”µ = blue, ðŸ”´ = red, ðŸŸ¡ = yellow, ðŸŸ¤ = brown, and ðŸŸ  = orange;
            for key pegs, of course, âš« = black and âšª = white. If you wish to set these diagrams up on a standard board,
            just
            substitute black for brown and white for orange.)</p>

        <p>The key pegs after the first guess in Diagram 7-25 indicated that the codebreaker had three colors right (and
            one
            wrong), but none were in the right place. So, for the second row, he quite correctly made an arbitrary
            assumptionâ€”a working hypothesisâ€”that green was incorrect. He moved the other three colors one space to the
            right
            and brought in a new color, red. The number of key pegs he receivedâ€”only <em>two</em> (a <em>decrease</em>
            from
            the number in the first row)â€”instantly revealed his errorâ€”or it should have. Why? Simple: He had three
            correct
            colors in the first row, only two in the second, <em>and he only changed one color.</em> Therefore, the
            color he
            droppedâ€”greenâ€”must have been correct, and the color he addedâ€”redâ€”could not be.</p>

        <p>His third guess, therefore, was a blunder, since it included red and failed to include green. Nonetheless, it
            yielded valuable informationâ€”again, simply from the <em>number</em> of key pegs. Using the same reasoning as
            before, we know that the color he addedâ€”blueâ€”belongs somewhere in the code, while the color he
            droppedâ€”yellowâ€”does not. Else how could the number of correct colors increase? (Note, too, that red, which
            weâ€”but not the codebreakerâ€”disqualified after the second round, cannot correspond to the first black key peg
            in
            the second row, since the red peg remained in place, while the black peg disappeared.) In fact, merely from
            the
            variation in the number of key pegs on the first three guesses, we can deduce exactly which colors (though
            not
            the positions) are in the code: green, brown, orange, and blue. From the second row, remember, we knew green
            was
            in and red out, and the three key pegs in the third row mean that all colors <em>but</em> red in the row are
            correct.</p>

        <p>Our dull-witted codebreaker's fourth guessâ€”which included both the taboo red and yellowâ€”was, therefore,
            almost a
            complete waste of time. So was the fifth, since we knew brown and green were in, and, with four colors
            determined, there could be no doubles. Searching for position could have been done more efficiently if the
            player had known what colors he was looking for. I don't know if our hapless codebreaker ever did figure out
            the
            code, but <em>we</em> can, at least. Brown can't be in positions #1 and #4, or there would have been a black
            key
            peg in the fifth row; nor can it be in position #3 (no black key pegs in the first row, either). Therefore,
            it
            must be in position #2. (That wasn't so hard, was it?) Again, the first, third, and fifth rows outlaw all
            positions for orange except the first, which, we see, means that it deserved the black key peg in the second
            row. That leaves only two positions, and green can't go into position #4 (no black key pegs in the fourth
            row).
            Thus, green goes into #3, and blue, by default, enters the #4 slot. The code is ðŸŸ -ðŸŸ¤-ðŸŸ¢-ðŸ”µ
            (orange-brown-green-blue).</p>

        <p>The examples that follow come from the Origins '78 (Fourth National Wargaming Convention) tournament or from
            actual games I have played elsewhere. Unlike our previous player, the codebreaker in the game represented by
            Diagram 7-26 made some incorrect <em>but logical</em> guesses and used data from his "mistakes" to arrive at
            the
            proper conclusion.</p>

        <p>From the information of the first set of key pegs, the codebreaker hypothesized that the brown, red, and
            green
            code pegs corresponded to the black, white, and white key pegs for the first row. So, for the second guess,
            brown stayed where it was; red and green moved; and blue was brought in to try in the place of the
            (temporarily)
            rejected orange. Wrong: Since the number of key pegs decreased, orange (the color that left) must be in the
            code, and the new color, blue, must be out. On the other hand, two of the three original "test" colors
            (i.e.,
            brown, red, and green) are correct, and brown still might be in the right spot. Since that left the fourth
            peg
            unaccounted for, the codebreaker brought in the last color, yellow; returned orange (but to a different
            position); discarded blue (permanently) and green (tentatively); moved red again; and retained brown in its
            slot.</p>

        <p>Wrong again, and this time the absence of a black key peg means that brown has to go (it might still be in
            the
            code, but not in the #1 slot). That means that the black key pegs in the first two rows referred to two
            different code pegs (either two different colors or the same color but in two different positionsâ€”indicating
            a
            "double"). Which ones? There is no way to tellâ€”not yet. However, the number of key pegs again tells us
            something. There were <em>two</em> color changes between the second and third rows; from our previous
            conclusions, though, we know that one switchâ€”replacing the blue with the orangeâ€”was correct. Since the
            number of
            key pegs (and, therefore, correct code pegs) remained the same, the other switchâ€”replacing the green with
            the
            yellowâ€”must be <em>incorrect</em>. So green is in, and both "newcomers" (the two that weren't part of the
            first
            row), yellow and blue, go to the reject pile. Since one of the original four colors is incorrect (either red
            or
            brown, we can now see), there is obviously a "double" in the code: that is, one of the three colors in the
            code
            is duplicated.</p>

        <p>Examine the codebreaker's fourth row carefully. By guessing red for the double, he maximized his
            informational
            input.<a href="#note2">[&sup2;]</a> Two key pegs would have meant that brown, not red, was in the code, but
            the
            three
            key pegs he actually got indicated his colors were right; only the double was wrong. Note also the
            elementary
            fact that the fourth guess was a <em>possible</em> result: The placement of the pegs was in agreement with
            all
            previous clues.</p>

        <p>It was, of course, wrong, but after that guess, a solution on the fifth row was, if not obvious, at least
            inevitable. Compare only the first and fourth rows. The black key peg cannot refer to the orange code peg
            (that
            is, orange cannot occupy the #4 slot), because that leaves no place (no black pegs for any of the other
            positions) for red. On the other hand, the black key peg in the first row can't be red's, either, for if it
            is,
            what can correspond to the black key peg in the fourth row? Not orange (which was sitting in the same
            position
            in the first row and couldn't have a black peg), not green (which is sitting in red's slot), and not red,
            which
            isn't a duplicate. That, obviously, leaves only green (brown is out, don't forget) for the #3 slot in the
            first
            row. Interestingly, that means the black peg in the second row corresponds to a green code peg, also (red
            would
            be stealing green's spot, and the other two colors in the row aren't in the code). That gives us the
            duplicate
            and its dual position, and the fourth row (again) proves red must be in the #1 position (no other color
            could
            deserve a black peg). That leaves orange for the #2 spot, and the code is solved.</p>

        <p>This example demonstrates a key point in code solving: Find a hypothesis that fits the facts, and stick with
            it
            until proved wrong. Otherwise, you'll get lost trying to juggle seventeen alternate possibilities
            simultaneously. There is a second point, also: After the second row, use only guesses that are possible
            solutions. This may seem obvious, but careful codebreakers do not always follow it.<a
                href="#note3">[&sup3;]</a>
        </p>

        <p>Most beginning <strong>Master Mind</strong> players open much like the two codebreakers seen so far: The
            second
            row is dependent on the results of the first and the whim of the moment. Most experienced players, however,
            use
            a planned opening: a two-row pattern played (almost) regardless of the codemaker's response to the first.
            (The
            second row thus becomes, often, a limited use of the "informative impossible.") While I am not wholly
            convinced
            that a planned opening is theoretically superior to the standard intuitive development, it does have a
            couple of
            practical advantages. To a definite degree, a planned opening provides the same kind of information every
            time;
            you know what to expect from it, what to look for. Second, it seems to allow you to draw clearer inferences
            faster than you normally do with a more haphazard opening, which too often involves juggling dozens of
            possibilities for three rounds or more. Rather than a fuzzy picture that suddenly becomes clear (like a
            photograph being developed), the planned opening allows (or forces) you to treat the code as a jigsaw puzzle
            put
            together one step at a time. For most people, this is probably easier to learn.</p>

        <p>The two most common planned openings are illustrated in the following pair of diagrams. Diagram 7-27 shows
            the
            opening generally described as 1-2-3-4, 5-1-2-3 (where the numbers represent not specific colors but a
            particular <em>pattern</em> of colors). Note that no attempt is made with this opening to drag in the sixth
            color until the third row.</p>

        <p>The response to the codebreaker's first guessâ€”a pair of white pegsâ€”is the least helpful clue you can get; one
            peg
            or three pegs are much better, and of course four pegs are best of all (though no pegs are a close second).
            Note
            that the pattern of the second guess invariably sets up the following possibilities: If the number of key
            pegs
            goes up, color #4 (in this example, yellow) is not in the code, but color #5 (here, blue) is; if the number
            of
            key pegs goes down, the reverse is true (blue's out, yellow's in); if the number of key pegs stays the same,
            as
            it did in this example, either <em>both</em> blue and yellow are in the code or <em>neither</em> is. Which
            is
            it, then? Obviously, there's no way to tell offhand, but there is a hint. If the number of key pegs involved
            is
            three, the odds are that neither color belongs; if there are only two key pegsâ€”or, especially, a single key
            pegâ€”it is more likely that both colors are in the code.</p>

        <p>For his third row, the codebreaker hypothesized (again, somewhat arbitrarily) that his following two pegs
            were
            correct in both color and position. Following the reasoning discussed in the previous paragraph, he brought
            back
            yellow in a new position and introduced, finally, the sixth colorâ€”here, green. The response of two black key
            pegs and a white one forced him to reexamineâ€”and rejectâ€”his hypothesis. From the two black pegs (only) in
            the
            second row, blue and orange were in the right positions or weren't in the code at all. From the two-row
            opening,
            either blue and yellow were both in, or neither was, and since the third row yielded three key pegs
            (impossible
            if two of the code pegs were not in the code at all), both had to be in. That meant blue belonged in the #1
            spot
            and orange was out. From the second row, then, either red or brown was in the code and in the right
            position.
            Green and yellow were in, and one of them (only) was properly placed in the third row. The fourth color was
            red
            or brown, one of which was in the right position in the second row. In neither case was it possible to tell
            which was correct; so the code could either be ðŸ”µ-ðŸŸ¢-ðŸŸ¡-ðŸŸ¤ (blue-green-yellow-brown) or ðŸ”µ-ðŸŸ¡-ðŸ”´-ðŸŸ¢
            (blue-yellow-red-green). In the actual game, the codebreaker
            fortunately guessed the latter.</p>

        <p>I have concentrated on the techniques of codebreaking because <strong>Master Mind</strong> is very definitely
            the
            codebreaker's game. Codemaker tactics are limited to picking a fairly random group of three or four colors.
            Odd
            codes with double doubles or a triple play may confuse your opponent momentarily, but any of a large number
            of
            guesses will reveal the deceit, and thereafter a codebreaker has only a small number of possibilities to
            contend
            with. In addition to the limitations of the unusual code, Diagram 7-28 illustrates the second standard
            planned
            openingâ€”1-2-3-4, 5-5-6-6â€”which works particularly well against doubles.</p>

        <p>Two black key pegs are slightly better than a pair of white ones, if not much. The absence of key pegs for
            the
            second row meant that only two colors from the first row were involved, and either one was a triple or both
            were
            doubles. As is my habit, I tried the two colors on the left and assumed a double double. (In this example,
            as in
            the previous one, I was the codebreaker.) The single black peg in the third row indicated a triple of either
            red
            or yellow. I kept the leftmost peg (green rather than blue, a typically arbitrary selection) and tried
            triple
            yellow because I thought my opponent might find the color combination more pleasing than the alternative.
            She
            did, and I was right.</p>

        <p>Like backgammonâ€”only more soâ€”<strong>Master Mind</strong> is easy enough to learn and quick enough to play to
            entice almost anyone to try it. My own suggestion is to begin with <strong>Mini Master Mind</strong>: while
            having fewer rows (six) than the standard ten, it is just as complicated as the regular game and can be kept
            as
            a pocket or travel set if you "outgrow" it. From there you can push on to the more elaborate and more
            flexible
            <strong>Super Master Mind</strong> (nÃ©e <strong>Deluxe Master Mind</strong>), which includes eight colors
            (or
            nine, with blanks) in five holes and is considerably more complicated. If you're still not sated, you can
            try
            sinking your teeth into <strong>Grand Master Mind</strong>, which mixes shapes and colors and has three
            kinds of
            key pegs. (But don't say you weren't warned.)
        </p>

        <p>One of <strong>Master Mind</strong>'s greatest advantages is that this flexibility allows two players of
            considerably different skill levels to compete on fairly even terms. The better player, for instance, could
            be
            forbidden to make codes with duplicates, while his opponent suffered no such prohibition. On a more
            sophisticated level (and where the gap in skill was greater), with <strong>Super Master Mind</strong>, one
            side
            could use more colors (or blanks) and/or more holes than the other. With a bit of experimentation, you
            should be
            able to come up with a handicap that allows you and your partner to guess each other's code, on average, in
            the
            same number of rows.</p>

        <p>A modern classic, <strong>Master Mind</strong> deserves a spot (or two) on everyone's gameshelf.</p>

            <p id="note1">&sup1; In the initial rounds of the Origins '78 (the Fourth National Wargaming Convention)
                tournament,
                breaking the code in four rows was common, but averages were higher in the final five-player round
                robin, and a
                four-game score there of 18 (a 4.5 row average) was good enough to send two of us into a "sudden death"
                playoff.
                After trying at four, I lost the second roundâ€”and the championshipâ€”by being extended to six guesses.</p>

            <p id="note2">&sup2; Had he doubled one of the othersâ€”except brownâ€”he would have been puzzled by a response
                of
                three
                key pegs. Was the double right and red wrong, or was red right and the wrong color duplicated?</p>

            <p id="note3">&sup3; The <em>deliberate</em> use of the "informative impossible"â€”a code the codebreaker
                <em>knows</em>
                cannot be right but which, through the information it yields, is intended to lower the expected solution
                average
                by a few percentage pointsâ€”is a legitimate technique but one which can profitably be pursued only by
                extremely
                sophisticated players. The edge it offers is slight, at best, and can be ignored without harm.
